# esg-portfolio-optimizer
 ESG-aware stock portfolio optimizer built with Streamlit &amp; Python
This ESG Portfolio Optimizer is a Streamlit-based web app that helps users build optimized stock portfolios with a focus on sustainability. Users can input stock tickers, set a minimum ESG score, and the app filters and allocates investments using PyPortfolioOpt to maximize returns and minimize risk. It pulls stock data from Yahoo Finance and ESG scores from Finnhub. Key features include portfolio performance metrics, pie charts, correlation heatmaps, Value at Risk (VaR), and a dark/light mode toggle. Itâ€™s a compact project demonstrating the blend of finance, ESG data, and Python-based analytics.
